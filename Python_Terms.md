1. **How Python uses Indentation to control Flow**
     * “control flow” in your code is to affect the order in which the code in your program is executed.
   Python’s syntax is quite flexible in terms of what it defines as a whitespace delimiter. Its rules are that:

    *One or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) is sufficient to serve as indentation.
    *A given indented block must use a uniform level of indentation. E.g. if the first line of an indented block has two leading spaces, all subsequent lines in that block must lead with exactly two white spaces.

1. **The DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself**
     * DRY stand for "Don't Repeat Yourself," a basic principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information. The DRY principle is stated as, "Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system."
