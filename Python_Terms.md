8. **Exception**

	An exception is an error that happens during execution of a program. When that error occurs, Python generate an exception that can be handled, which avoids your program to crash.

9. **Unit Test**

	Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. The unittest test framework is python's xUnit style framework.

10. **Constructor**

	A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class. Python relies on the constructor to perform tasks such as initializing (assigning values to) any instance variables that the object will need when it starts

11. **Factory**
	Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

	Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (_new_ operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
