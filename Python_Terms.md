1. **How Python uses Indentation to control Flow**
     * “control flow” in your code is to affect the order in which the code in your program is executed.
   Python’s syntax is quite flexible in terms of what it defines as a whitespace delimiter. Its rules are that:

    *One or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) is sufficient to serve as indentation.
    *A given indented block must use a uniform level of indentation. E.g. if the first line of an indented block has two leading spaces, all subsequent lines in that block must lead with exactly two white spaces.

1. **The DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself**
1. **Design Patterns from Gang of Four**
      * Everything starts with the Gang of Four (GOF). Do a quick online search if you are not familiar with the GOF.
      Design patterns are a common way of solving well known problems. 
      * Two main principles are in the bases of the design patterns defined by the GOF:
          * Program to an interface not an implementation.
          * Favor object composition over inheritance.
